# Vocabulary builder export

I am fascinated by languages, etymology of words, and how the origins of languages also connect cultures and people. Now I want to study something I intended for a long time, namely the Merriam-Webster's Vocabulary Builder. I believe that studying this not only can improve my knowledge of the English language, but also it will help me learn more languages, such as Norwegian or Spanish. However, there are many roots to be studied, and even more example words. To this end, I started a project to automate the process of extracting the information from the .pdf file I have, storing the data in suitable format, and finally importing it into Anki, to create flashcards to facilitate studying.

This project is done purely for my own interests, on the cross-section of two fields I am passionate about: data and programming, and languages! :-)
